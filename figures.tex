    An example of a professionally-produced probabilistic visualization \cite{badger2018extensive} 
    (\url{https://nyti.ms/2GGpFZw})
    I would both like to be able to support \textbf{and} improve. This visualization falls victim to the \emph{fallacy of the transposed conditional}: by normalizing bar heights on the right-hand 
    side, it depicts $P(race|income~class \wedge grew~up~rich)$ only, so one cannot see 
    $P(income~class | race \wedge grew~up~rich)$: imagine if very few boys of either race who grew up rich ended up in a lower class, then $P(income~class \neq rich | race = black \wedge grew~up~rich)$ would be low even if $P(race = black | income~class \neq rich \wedge grew~up~rich)$ is high. It is worth noting that by reading the numbers in the table to the right it is possible to verify that this is not the case for this particular visualization, but this is difficult to verify from the visualization alone. A probabilistic grammar of graphics would have users explicitly specify the desired distributions, avoiding this error, and would create a similar animation sequence automatically, where this example was custom built in JavaScript.

    We propose a new model for graphical perception experiments. A and B illustrate the current model of experiments, where competing visualization designs are evaluated and performance reported for the \emph{average} participant, which by definition leads to overly stringent and possibly incorrect design recommendations in the visualiztion community. C illustrates our proposed framework, in which we \emph{transform} the focus of visualization experiments from evaluating charts to evaluating people, using scalable experiment designs and robust statistical measures. We evaluate our framework using multiple established experiments across diverse participant pools. We evaluate our results through a focused interview study with visualization practitioners. This new model moves to improve and tighten the feedback loop in visualization research, transforming experiments from artifacts to design assets for effective communication through data visualization.
    (*~Can you spot which is most correlated? Our experiments target differences in abilities like this. See the last figure for the answer.)
